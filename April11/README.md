# Simple Music Instructment

## Description:
Our work is a simple piano that can be played in two mode, day mode and night mode. When the light is on, the user can play the piano from note C4-F4,
and the user can play the piano from note C3-F3 when the light is off. Each of the four button swich on the bread board is corresponding to C, D, E, F
respectively, and the photoresistor is the analog sensor that can change the pitch of the whole piano from C3 to C4. We went to the IM lab to get
a big speaker instead of using the normal size buzzer, which make the voice a lot better.

## Process:
We were thinking how to start the music instructment assignment, and later Dhabia shared the idea she had when browsing online which is a simple version 
eletronic piano. Later, we had the idea of changing the mode to make this piano a bit different than others. So, we decided to use the analog sensor to be
the variable to change the mode. In the end, the idea is to create a piano that plays different tone during day and night.
