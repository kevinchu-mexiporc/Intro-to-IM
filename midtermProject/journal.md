# Midterm Project Journal-Chicken Attack
## Initial Concept:
Since vi0lent games are banned, I want to construct a weirdly satisfying and humurous game instead. The idea in my head is originned from a game I played with my friends when I was little which is called "eagle catches chicks." 

I am not sure if there is such game in other regions, but the game is about a person plays as a ham protecting other players playing as her chicks lining up behind her from the opponent player in the role of eagle. To avoid the potential violence of the game and to make the game even cuter, I decided to let the player proect eggs from the raindrops. There will be one ham in the frame walking and laying egges randomly, and the mission for the player wll be controlling a brick above them to protect the eggs from the keep randomly generating raindrops.

The game comes to the end when the player failed to protect 5 eggs from the raindrops, and the player is considered as failing to protect an egg when there are three raindrops falling on it before the chick break the eggshell. I now set the time for a chick to break the eggshell in 10 seconds, but will adjust that if it does not work well. The game will keep the score in terms of how many eggs have cracked successfully and the life of the player in terms of 5 chances to fail to protect the eggs. Also, to increase the hardness of the game, I will let the ham lays the eggs faster as the player survives for longer.
