## Inspiration and Description of the Game:

### Inspiration:

At first, I want to construct a warmly satisfying game. The idea in my head is originned from a game called "eagle catches chicks." 
I rename the game after a funny song called "Chicken Attack" to add a sense of humor.
The way I constructed the game somehow took a u-turn into an game based on the vibe of that song, which is very weird and trolling.

### Description:

The game is a platform controlled by the player to protect the eggs lay by the ham randomly walking at the bottom of the frame from the raindrops keep falling from the sky. The thing the player has to do is just move the platform with the mouse which is very simple. During the game, the player's life starts from 5 and the score starts from 0. When an egg is protected long enough, the egg will hatch and turn into a chick, and the player gets one point. When an egg is hit by raindrops for three times, the egg will disappear, and the player will lose one life. the game ends when the player's life turns 0.

The game has the song "Chicken Attack" as the background music that will keep looping before the player exit the game (which is very annoying i have to admit). This is the soul of the whole game, the trolling vibe. To be consistent to the trolling vibe I selected the images of the ham, the eggs, the raindrops, and the chicks all from the emoji library. Also, the background image is the set of the most classic scene in the "Chicken Attack" music video. When a chick hatches from the egg, a rooster sound will play to make the game funnier and to let players get an instant notice that they got a point. On the other hand, a explode sound will play when a raindrop hits an egg to let players know their chickens are facing an attack.
